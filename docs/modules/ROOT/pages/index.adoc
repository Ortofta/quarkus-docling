This is a Quarkus extension for the https://github.com/docling-project[Docling project]. Docling simplifies document processing, parsing diverse formats — including advanced PDF understanding — and providing seamless integrations with the gen AI ecosystem.

Currently, this extension is a set of wrappers around the https://github.com/docling-project/docling-serve[Docling Serve] project, which exposes Docling as a REST API. It also provides a Dev Service and Dev UI integrations.

The eventual goal is to unify the https://docling-project.github.io/docling/concepts/docling_document[DoclingDocument] format with https://docs.langchain4j.dev/tutorials/rag#document[LangChain4j's `Document` abstraction] so that Docling can be used in a LangChain4j RAG pipeline for ingesting data.
